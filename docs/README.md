# CSE 310 Applied Programming - Module 1
## Task Management API

### Project Overview
A RESTful API for managing tasks that meets all module requirements including variables, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, data structures, file I/O, and external API integration.

### Features
- REST API with Express.js
- In-memory data storage with Task class
- File read/write operations
- External weather API integration
- Comprehensive error handling
- 250+ lines of well-commented code

### Requirements Met
✅ Variables, expressions, conditionals, loops  
✅ Functions and custom Task class  
✅ Data structures (arrays, objects, classes)  
✅ File I/O operations (read/write)  
✅ External API integration  
✅ 100+ lines of code (250+ actual)  
✅ Code comments throughout  

### Installation

### Learning Reflection
This project helped me understand REST API design, asynchronous programming, file operations in Node.js, and external API consumption. The most valuable lesson was implementing proper error handling and learning to structure a complete application from scratch.
